## 1. Introduction and Theoretical Framework

The Weight attribute is a Cisco proprietary parameter used in BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for best path selection. Its main characteristics are:

* **Local Scope:** It has meaning exclusively within the local router where it is configured and is not propagated via BGP routing updates to neighbors.
* **Value Range:** An integer number between 0 and 65,535.
* **Default Values:** Routes originated locally by the router receive a weight of 32,768 by default; routes learned from external or internal neighbors receive a weight of 0 by default.
* **Precedence:** It is evaluated in the absolute first place within BGP's decision algorithm (above Local Preference, AS_PATH, MED, etc.). Routes with a higher Weight value have absolute preference.

## 2. Build a Sample Web App in a Docker Container
 

**Part 2.1:** Launch the DEVASC VM

* Launch the DEVASC Virtual Machine using VirtualBox or VMWare.

## Part 2: Create a Simple Bash Script
Bash scripting is a prerequisite for automation, CI/CD, and managing development environments[cite: 1]. 

1. **Create and navigate to the working directory**:
   ```bash
   cd labs/devnet-src/sample-app/
   touch user-input.sh



![BGP WEIGTH](images/01Topologia.jpg)

 four routers across different Autonomous Systems (AS 100, AS 200, AS 300, and AS 400). Before advertising prefixes, BGP neighbor adjacencies were established on each device.

## 3. BGP Configuration:

**Router A (RTA - AS 100):**
